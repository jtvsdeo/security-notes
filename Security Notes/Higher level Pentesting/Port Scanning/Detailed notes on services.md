# Detailed notes

## DNS
### Forward Lookup Brute Force
Use common hostnames and bruteforce using the `host test.google.com` command
If this resolves to scattered IP addresses in a range…
  
### Reverse lookup Brute Force
Scan ip addresses in the range and for an ip address range.   
You can grep -v “not found”  

### DNS Zone transfers
-   Database replication between dns servers, which zone file is copied from master to slave server
-   If misconfigured, anyone asking for a copy of the DNS Server Zone will usually receive one

**Host command for zone transfers**
`host -l` (list zone)  

`host -l megacorpone.com ns2.megacorpone.com`
This should dump out the zone file for the megaropone.com domain with a list of IP and DNS Hostnames

### Relevant tools
**dnsrecon**
`dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -t axfr`  
`-d` for domain name
`-t` for enumeration type, this case was Zone Transfer
