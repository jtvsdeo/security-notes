# Introduction

Pivoting is essentially the idea of moving to other networks through a compromised host to find more targets on different network segments.


### Lateral Movement
Further our access to additional hosts, applications and services within a nerwork enivironment. 

**Example:**
>During an assessment, we gained initial access to the target environment and were able to gain control of the local administrator account. We performed a network scan and found three more Windows hosts in the network. We attempted to use the same local administrator credentials, and one of those devices shared the same administrator account. We used the credentials to move laterally to that other device, enabling us to compromise the domain further.


### Piovting
Utilizing multiple hosts to cross network boundaries you would not usually have access to. This is moving deeper into a network by comprimising targetted hosts or infrastructure

**Example:**
> Searching the network and compromising a host that has multiple physical NIC's  connected to different networks. Using this we could pivot to the other network.


### Tunneling
We often find ourselves using various protocols to shuttle traffic in/out of a network where there is a chance of our traffic being detected.

**Example:**
> Using SSH rather than telnet 


### Conclusion
 Lateral Movement helps us spread wide within a network, elevating our privileges, while Pivoting allows us to delve deeper into the networks accessing previously unreachable environments.
