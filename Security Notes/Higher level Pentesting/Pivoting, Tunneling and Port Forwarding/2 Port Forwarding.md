# Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling
> Port forwarding is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another.


### SSH Local Port Forwarding

We can either access the MySQL service by SSH'ing to the server or we can port forward it on our localhost and access it locally.
Benefit of accessing it locally is we can execute a remote exploit on the MYSQL Service

`ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 Ubuntu@10.129.202.64`

-L tells SSH client to request server to forward all data we send via port 1234 to localhost:3306 (localhost is ubuntu )

Now we can access MySQL on 1234


 If we want to forward multiple ports from the Ubuntu server to your localhost, you can do so by including the `local port:server:port` argument to your ssh command. For example, the below command forwards the apache web server's port 80 to your attack host's local port on 8080.

`ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64`
