# Burpsuite
> Information Dump, know how to use burp, these are just basic pointers


### Modes
**Intruder:** Set a payload and go through a wordlist
	Sniper - Single payload set
	Pitchfork - Multiple payload sets
**Repeater:** Can send multiple requests and modify
**Proxy:** Intercepts your request

Try to spider to find out subdomains and files of a host
Always URL encode before sending in anything with spaces

------------ 

**Situation:**  
Trying to bruteforce a login page, but they have set_session and token field that change every request.

**Solution: Recursive Grep**
Carefully checking the html code, we can locate the token and set_session in the responses.


We need something that can extract values from a response and inject them into the next request. Burp Suite includes a “Recursive grep” payload that searches a response with grep for a predefined value and makes the results available for the next request. This is exactly what we need to set the phpMyAdmin cookie value, set_session post body value, and the token field.
