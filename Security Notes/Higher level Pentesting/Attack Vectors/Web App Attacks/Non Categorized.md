### Bruteforcing 
 Make sure to check for response code as well as lengths of the replies
 Medusa, Hydra, Burpsuite. 
 Can bruteforce htaccess protected folder
 crowbar - password attacks against rdp
 medusa - fast pw attack
 

**Reregistration**
You can register again but with a space in front of the username or null byte at the end


### JSON Web Token (jwt)
 It lets the website know what kind of access the currently logged in user has.

So if I intercept the request and I get a jwt, I can decode it and change the values and send it back to them with my own shit. This is gonna change the cookie and give me another user's access.


### No auth required
The url looks like this: Â ****[http://10.10.227.134:7777/users/0](http://10.10.227.134:7777/users/0)
I can change the value after users and access other users.


### IDOR
Makse sure anytime there are accounts, or any type of user ownership, you check how they get the ownership and how they deal with it.

Check network tab, check burp, see where the requests are going and whats coming back. Make sure you access something youre not supposed to. Monitor requests properly.
