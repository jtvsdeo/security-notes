### Fixing web exploits
**Checklist:**
• Does it initiate an HTTP or HTTPS connection?
• Does it access a web application specific path or route?
• Does the exploit leverage a pre-authentication vulnerability?
• If not, how does the exploit authenticate to the web application?
• How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vulnerability?
• Does it rely on default application settings (such as the web path of the application) that may have been changed after installation?
• Will oddities such as self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?
