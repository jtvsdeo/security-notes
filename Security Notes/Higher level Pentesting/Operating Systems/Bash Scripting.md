# Bash Scripting

### Variables  
Assinging a variable - use no spaces
`num=1`  
To reference this variable, use a dollar sign  
`echo $num`

### Quotes  
**Single quotes:** Bash treats every single character literally
**Double quotes:** All chars are viewed literally except "$", tilda and " \ "


### Additional
`$()` will execute whatever is in the parenthesis
For example
```
user=$(whoami)
echo $user
```
This will print `kali`  

### Command Arguments
`$1`  in a script take the first arguments, $n is will take the n'th argument 
For example:   
```
echo "Arg1: $1"
./script.sh test1
```
Will print out Arg1: test1
