# Stacks

### What is a stack?
A stack is a limited access data structure – elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. It works on LIFO (last-in-first-out) principle.

Stack supports two operations push and pop.  
**Push:** Adds an item to the top of the stack.  
**Pop:** Removes an item from the top of the stack.

### CPU Registers

-   **EIP** instruction pointer - points to the next instruction to be executed
-   **ESP** stack pointer - points to top of stack
-   **EBP** base pointer - stores address of the base
-   **ESI** source index
-   **EDI** destination index
-   **EAX** accumulator
-   **EBX** base
-   **ECX** counter
-   **EDX** data
