# Buffer Overflow


A buffer overflow occurs when a program receives data that is longer than expected, such that it overwrites the entire buffer memory space on the [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)). This can overwrite the next Instruction Pointer `EIP` (_or `RIP` in x86_64_), which causes the program to crash because it will attempt to execute instructions at an invalid memory address.

If we are a bit more sophisticated, we can change the address of `EIP` to an instruction that will execute our shellcode.
